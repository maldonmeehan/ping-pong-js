## Description

This is an Epicodus student project to create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the inputed number with the following exceptions. This lesson is to use Node to create a command-line version of the ping-pong app we made back in Intro to Programming.
* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"
* The user will be able to a new number and see new results over and over again.
